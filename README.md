A easy sticker collection mananger for iMessage

When using iMessage, just like other social platforms, send emoticons. But iMessage is not free to add your favorite emoticons like other social platforms, and send the emoticons you want to send when you want to send them.ðŸ˜Š

Recently, my friends encountered this pain point, so I developed this app.

You can manually add stickers through the app, and then sort them and view them in iMessage, and use your favorite stickers like other mainstream social software!

* Create emoticons
* Add your favorite emoticons in the emoticon set
* Save information such as the author and name of the emoji collection
* Save the name and other information of the emoji package
* Freely choose the emoticon package collection in iMessage, and send your favorite emoticon package to your friends
